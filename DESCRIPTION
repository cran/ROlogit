Description: Implements the rank-ordered logit (RO-logit) model for stratified 
    analysis of continuous outcomes introduced by 
    Tan et al. (2017) <doi:10.1177/0962280217747309>. Model diagnostics based on 
    the heuristic residuals and estimates in linear scales are available from 
    the package, and outcomes with ties are supported.
